# Search Bar component

This is a generic npm installable search bar component written in React.

## Development

Follow these steps to get started developing your own react component:

* `git clone git@github.com:CliqueScope/searchbar.git`
* `npm install`
* `npm run dev` to transpile both the lib and docs folder in watch mode and serve the docs page for you.
* Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see the demo in action. Whenever you change the code in either src/lib or src/docs, the page will automatically update.
